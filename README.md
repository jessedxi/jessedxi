I am a junior full-stack web developer, switching gears from 10+ years as a manager in the automotive service industry.  I've taken the opportunity to learn and grow, expanding my skillset, in response to the downturn faced by my field of work.  I've now turned my sights towards a long time interest of mine and have attended Lighthouse Labs' immersive web development program. I am eager to apply my newfound knowledge towards future algorithms as I nurture my skills further.
